The game of snakes and ladders was originally designed with a spiritual
purpose, its movement representing ascension to enlightenment via 
virtues, or unplanned descent via vices. The later, western adaptation
forgot its karmic lessons and became a practice of luck.

The board’s format is a section through a tall building. Described
literally in the original, the only hint in the modern version that this
is an architectural representation of 3D space (i.e. a section) is the
presence of the ladder.

Year of the Ladder is a generative, responsive self-playing board game,
drawn with the visual languages of architectural illustration and textile
art - ornamental, tactile, interior. 

Movement is directed by the rules of dice, snakes and ladders, however these 
guides are hidden and we see only traces of their consequences rippling through
the board. Just one output reveals the mechanics; this is the ‘back of the
cloth’, the structural CAD drawing, and homage to the game’s digital
descendent (Donkey Kong).
